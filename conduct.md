# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Cascade STEAM represents a community of aspiring, current, and retired STEAM professionals and the many roles that support and advocate STEAM Education in our beautiful region. We celebrate and encourage diversity. All are welcome.

We commit to create a safe and inviting environment for all members of our community to express themselves, including their diverse points of view. We believe the vast majority of our community members are respectful individuals who share our commitment. We also believe it is important to create an explicit social contract to define our shared values, and — perhaps more importantly — describe what happens when those values are breached.

## Summary
**Our Code of Conduct is simply: Be honest, respectful, and professional.**

## Code of Conduct
- Be honest.
- Be respectful.
- Be professional.
- Follow the law.
- Follow situational rules, if any.
- Be mindful of how you represent yourself.

### Immediacy
All Cascade STEAM participants agree to abide by this Code of Conduct regarding their behavior. Any directive by a Cascade STEAM representative concerning a potential violation of this Code of Conduct must be followed immediately, but may be appealed after 24 hours.

### Minor Offense
You are encouraged to respectfully communicate a minor offense directly to the individual(s) involved in an attempt to resolve amicably. We aspire to be open minded individuals who can learn and grow with the corrective input of our peers. The remainder of this Code of Conduct and Report process is designed for circumstances where this is not reasonable or appropriate and an official response is warranted.

### Details
- “Behavior” includes any communication (written, verbal, nonverbal, or visual) or act.
- “Activities” include any Cascade STEAM event, activity, or program.
- All federal, state, and local laws must be followed.
- Any situational rules must be followed, if applicable, including location rules and/or additional rules of an event or program.
- A “ Cascade STEAM Representative” includes any individual from Leadership, including Staff, Board of Directors, Committee Members, and Organizers.
- Any consequence of a directive, if any, may be appealed after 24 hours.
- Consequence of ignoring a directive by a Cascade STEAM representative is described in Report Response, below.

### Report
Please report any conduct unbecoming of a Cascade STEAM participant and/or occurring at a Cascade STEAM activity via the [Cascade STEAM Code of Conduct Report Form](http://conduct-report.cascadesteam.org). A report submission is REQUIRED to collect necessary information for action. In addition to a written report, you may also directly report to any individual of Cascade STEAM Leadership for awareness or potential immediate intervention.

Note: Reporter is NOT required to include contact information, but including contact information is encouraged to help in responding to the code of conduct report.

### Report Review
Upon receiving a report, the Cascade STEAM Board of Directors will convene and assemble a team from Cascade STEAM Leadership to respond to the report, including reviewing and investigating the report and determining the appropriate response.

### Report Response
A Report Response will be written and separately provided to reporter, reportee, and Cascade STEAM Leadership. Response may include no action, warning, or ban from participation in Cascade STEAM activities. Ban may include revocation of organization benefits without refund, if applicable. Time period may vary from one month to indefinitely.

### Appeal
A directive or Report Response by a Cascade STEAM representative may be appealed after 24 hours via the same Cascade STEAM Code of Conduct Report Form. An appeal will prompt re-assessment of a directive or Report Response if significant new information is provided. The Report Response of an Appeal is final.

### Legal Matters
Any legal matter will be immediately reported to the proper authorities.
