# Bellingham Linux Users Group

Since 1998, the Bellingham Linux Users Group has hosted meetings open to everyone interested in Linux, GNU, and open source software and hardware. Since COVID, BLUG has relaunched as a collaboration with community organizers from [Bellingham Codes](https://bellingham.codes), the [BTC Raspberry Pi Club](https://raspberrypiclub.org/), and [Cascade STEAM](/)!

Cascade STEAM Programs are: *“Free. Open to everyone. All are welcome. Family friendly. Bring your friends!”*

## Meetings

We plan to meet Monthly every third Wednesday of the month from 5:30pm – 7:00pm at the Bellingham Makerspace. Meeting details will be available on this page, the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org/), and the [Cascade STEAM Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/cascadesteam).

Planned meetings in 2025 include: January 15th, February 19th, March 19th, April 16th, May 21th, June 18th, July 16th, September 17th, October 15th, and November 19th. We will not hold meetings in August or December. Join us for Cascade STEAM Socials on these months instead!
