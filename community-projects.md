# Community Projects

Cascade STEAM Community Projects are organized collaborative efforts to provide strategic support from the STEAM community for community impact and social good. We collaborate with fellow nonprofit organizations working on community impact programs to provide strategic support and community engagement and we welcome all people of all ages to participate. Organization and discussion occurs at our [Community Group](/community-groups) meetings and on our [Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org). See our [Meetup Page](https://meetup.com/cascadesteam) for scheduled events. See below for details of current Community Projects.

## Stormwater Monitoring Project

Join the Citizen Science Community Group as we continue our organizing and support of [RE Sources](https://re-sources.org) and their [Stormwater Monitoring Project](https://www.re-sources.org/2024/06/three-years-of-bellingham-stormwater-monitoring-reveals-pollution-hotspots-including-taylor-dock/) to help protect Bellingham Bay. Organizers are working to create science, technology, and administrative projects and subprojects for community members to easily plug into and contribute as we work together as a team to resolve challenges.
 
**About RE Sources:**

Founded in 1982, [RE Sources](https://re-sources.org) is a nonprofit organization working to protect the environment and communities of the central Salish Sea region and our climate. We catalyze community action to build a lasting legacy for all of us â€” clean water, protected shorelines, an end to dangerous fossil fuel projects, and recovery for orcas and salmon.

Based in Bellingham, Washington, we are a team of trusted and time-tested environmental advocates, educators and scientists. RE Sources gives people practical ways to make a real difference for the planet, from passing stronger laws that protect the environment and empowering youth voices, to holding corporate polluters accountable, reducing waste and our own carbon footprint. We do this through smart policy, grassroots mobilization, hands-on science and environmental education.

Our deep roots and broad connections in Northwest Washington allow us to inspire and mobilize thousands of people to protect the beauty and bounty of the region.
