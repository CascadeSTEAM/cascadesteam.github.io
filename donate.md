# Donate

Cascade STEAM Programs are *“Free. Open to everyone. All are welcome. Family friendly. Bring your friends\!”* on purpose: We keep participation free *“for all people of all ages”* as a commitment to Digital Equity.

If you value our work and have the financial means to support us, then please donate\! Cascade STEAM is community supported. Your donation will fund our operations and programs, and allow us to manage our own small grants for [community projects](/community-projects).

While Cascade STEAM is NOT a member organization with dues, we do encourage a suggested annual donation of $100 for professionals and $1,000 for organizations. Any donation amount is appreciated. As Cascade STEAM is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization your donation is tax deductible.

We have four methods to accept your donation: Check, [PayPal Giving Fund](https://www.paypal.com/fundraiser/charity/5056769), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=CLBXLN2E2ZU7C), or [Venmo](https://account.venmo.com/charity/donate?charity=3993349652481532884). 

Note: Both Check and PayPal Giving Fund provide the full amount of your donation, however PayPal Giving Fund may take up to 45 days to process. PayPal and Venmo charge a discounted processing fee for nonprofits and include a mechanism for you to optionally cover this fee. Checks may be made payable to ”Cascade STEAM” with "Donation" memo and mailed to “104 W. Magnolia St \#2551, Bellingham, WA 98225”.
