# Mentorship

Cascade STEAM Mentorship connects community members interested in STEAM in either a "Traditional Mentorship" or "Peer Mentorship" arrangement and provides a support structure for a positive mentorship experience for all.

"Traditional Mentorship" pairs a junior and senior member based on personal and professional interests to help the junior member (mentee) establish and progress goals while the senior member provides personal and professional guidance (mentor).

"Peer Mentorship" pairs either junior or senior members together to create a peer relationship as they work on self improvement topics together. Goals are separately established by each peer based on their own interests, and mentorship occurs via the collaboration, accountability, and encouragement of Peer Mentorship partners.

For Spring/Summer 2025, Mentorship is designed for college students, professionals, and retired professionals. Stay tuned for the expansion of mentorship for those younger than 18 years old. 

## How It Works

- You must be 18 years of age by May 1, 2025 to apply.
- If you are not yet a member of the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org) (Discord), we welcome you to [create a Discord account](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started) and join our server, although this is NOT required. We use Discord for public, private, and group communications.
- Submit your application to participate as a Mentee, Mentor, or Peer Mentor Partner by April 28, 2025.
- Mentorship Program Organizers will match applicants based on interests.
- Mentorship Pairs are introduced on May 1, 2025.
- Participants meet with their mentorship partner ~twice per month for ~one hour in May, June, & July. A mentorship handbook will be provided to help provide a positive mentorship experience for all.
- While organized mentorship activities for this cohort end after a three month period, we encourage participants to stay connected.
