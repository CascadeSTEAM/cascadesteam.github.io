# Mentorship

Cascade STEAM Mentorship connects community members interested in STEAM in either a "Traditional Mentorship" or "Peer Mentorship" arrangement and provides a support structure for a positive mentorship experience for all.

"Traditional Mentorship" pairs a junior and senior member based on personal and professional interests to help the junior member (mentee) establish and progress goals while the senior member provides personal and professional guidance (mentor).

"Peer Mentorship" pairs either junior or senior members together to create a peer relationship as they work on self improvement topics together. Goals are separately established by each peer based on their own interests, and mentorship occurs via the collaboration, accountability, and encouragement of Peer Mentorship partners.

For Spring/Summer 2025, Mentorship is designed for college students, professionals, and retired professionals. Stay tuned for the expansion of mentorship for those younger than 18 years old. 

## How It Works

Mentorship is integrated into Cascade STEAM Community Groups, each convening separately in recurring meetings to discuss topical interests and connect with fellow community members. Current Cascade STEAM Community Groups currently include: Citizen Science, Cybersecurity, Data Engineering, Linux, and Software Development.
