## About
Cascade STEAM is a newly forming nonprofit organization dedicated to improving STEM Education, Career Connected Learning, Digital Literacy, and Digital Equity for all people of all ages.

STEAM is an acronym for the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics. STEAM education is a powerful framework to promote curiosity and creativity, encourage a shared learning experience, and build tools to solve important life challenges. We advocate STEAM education through development and promotion of events, activities, and programs. We invite collaboration with community partners in shared purpose.

## Mission
Develop and promote STEAM Education, Career Connected Learning, Digital Literacy, and Digital Equity for all people of all ages.

## Values
- STEAM is our framework.
- Digital Equity is our goal.
- Digital Literacy is our foundation.
- Everyone deserves equal opportunity.
- Open to everyone. All are welcome. Family Friendly.
- Our code of conduct: Be honest, respectful, and professional.

## Community Function

In alignment with organization purpose, mission, and values, we will facilitate engagement with the community to:

- Cultivate a community-action platform that promotes participation, engagement, and communication.
- Provide direct value to the community through community service and public interest programs.
- Support infrastructure organizations such as libraries, schools, education service districts, and STEM/STEAM Networks.
- Advocate through development and promotion of events, activities, and programs.
