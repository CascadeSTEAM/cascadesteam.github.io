# Cascade STEAM Cyber

Welcome to Cascade STEAM’s Cyber-focused community group! We are just getting started as a community group and we’d love to have you join us at an upcoming meeting. Meetings are free and all are welcome. Anyone with an interest in cybersecurity is welcome and encouraged to attend. Please help us by spreading the word to friends and colleagues.

## Meetings

We plan to meet on the second Thursday of the Month from ~5:30-7:00pm at various locations. Meeting details will be available on this page, the [Cascade STEAM Community Hub](http://hub.cascadesteam.org), and the [Cascade STEAM Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/cascadesteam).

Planned 2025 meeting dates include May 8th, June 12th, July 10th, September 11th, October 9th, and November 13th. We will not hold meetings in August or December. Join us for Cascade STEAM Socials on these months instead!

### Meeting #3 - July 2025

Join us as we continue to work on organizing our group and building a local cybersecurity community. Our meetings are free and anyone with an interest in Cybersecurity is welcome to attend.

**Cascade STEAM Cyber Meeting #3 - July 2025**<br>
Thursday July 10, 2025 @ 5:20pm-7:00pm<br>
Brandywine Kitchen<br>
[1317 Commercial Street, Bellingham, WA 98225](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U8uVCUGp7GXPszZx8)

**Timeline:**<br>
5:20 - Doors open (perhaps arrive a little earlier if you might want to order food/drinks)<br>
5:40 - Meeting begins<br>

* Career Spotlight & Presentation: Chris Ranallo, Director of IT for Lummi Nation. He will be talking about how they built a cybersecurity and IT program, and available to discuss issues around public sector IT and cybersecurity. Few of us have had the need (opportunity?) to build a program from the ground up, so this should be an interesting perspective!<br>
6:30-7:00 - Wrap up and networking/social time
