# Cascade STEAM Citizen Science

Citizen Science is a Cascade STEAM [Community Group](community-groups) with a focus on science and science-related [community projects](community-projects).

Calling all aspiring Citizen Scientists\! Cascade STEAM is kicking off Citizen Science with a [Community Project](community-projects) to understand and improve the stormwater monitoring for Bellingham. In this group you'll learn about the techniques used by the [City of Bellingham](https://cob.org/services/environment/stormwater), [Washington State Department of Ecology](https://ecology.wa.gov/water-shorelines/water-quality/nonpoint-pollution/stormwater), and the local non-profit [RE Sources](https://re-sources.org) to ensure Bellingham Bay is minimally impacted by stormwater run-off. To learn more see this great summary of the [ReSources Stormwater Monitoring Project](https://www.re-sources.org/2024/06/three-years-of-bellingham-stormwater-monitoring-reveals-pollution-hotspots-including-taylor-dock/).

Cascade STEAM Programs are: *“Free. Open to everyone. All are welcome. Family friendly. Bring your friends\!”*
