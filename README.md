# Our Mission
Develop and promote STEM learning experiences for all people of all ages.

# About Us
Whatcom STEM is a newly forming nonprofit organization dedicated to improving STEM Education, Career Connected Learning, Digital Literacy, and Digital Equity for all people of all ages.

STEM education is a powerful framework to promote curiosity and creativity, encourage a shared learning experience, and build tools to solve important life challenges.

We advocate STEM education through development and promotion of events, activities, and programs, including a community hub, community groups, and mentorship. We invite collaboration with community partners in shared purpose.
